            <p>
                Overall I think ESPN uses whitespace very well on there site.  
                It really helps you focus on whatever part of the page you want to look at.
                On the page they have words, numbers, and images all of various sizes.
                The white space allows you to see clearly the score to a game(large font),
                the teams names(medium font), and how much time is left in the game(small font).

            <h2>Alignment</h2>
            <a href="www.foxnews.com">Fox News</a><img src="/joewatt40.github.io/lesson2/images/fox.jpg" alt="fox screenshot">
            <p>
                With not a lot of content on the screen Fox News does a pretty good job of making small alignment changes to help the content
                seperate from other content.  The images take up the whole width of the screen, but they
                indent and align the caption for the image and the header that shows a hierarcy. Then they
                indent the article links a little more, same amount as header from the edge, which
                causes your eyes to follow the indentation path to the article links and then hopefully
                click on a link and stay on their site.

            <p>
                For a company that makes the money Apple does and holds so much market 
                share on phones and mobile devies, you don't have to choose a lot from
                there main page. They put a new product first with links to learn more about
                it, but when you click on the menu in the upper left corner you are given 
                an option to choose any of there products.  They also have a link to shop
                on there site, but it doesn't take from displaying a product.  As you scroll
                down he screen they continue with one product on the screen most of the way
                down.
